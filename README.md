# Business <a name="business"></a>

The business goals of this page are to provide accurate weather information to the user.

## External Users Goals

The external users goals of this page are to provide accurate weather information for any location around the globe. Including humidity, wind speed and temperature.

## Site Owners Goals

The site owners goals of this page are to provide clear weather data using the Open Weather API.

# Colour Scheme <a name="color-scheme"></a>

The site uses a background image of a city skyline at night. I've also added a dark border with a low opacity around the div containing the weather information. To make this stand out I've included a bright green border around the div, buttons and input fields. On hover these turn bright green.

## Body Colour

The body for this site uses an image of a city skyline. This fills the entire page with no repeats and is scalable on large and small screens including mobile.

## Font Family

![image](readMeImgs/Screenshot%202023-02-23%20at%2012.09.48.png)

I have used a font from Google Fonts named Outfit. Outfit is clean and easy to read and makes for a better alternative to the standard fonts in my opinion.

# Wireframes <a name="wireframes"></a>

I have made wire frames for desktop and mobile. These can be seen below. This app has basically the same layout on mobile and desktop due to the simplicity of the UI.
