# Jason Blackburn - Web Developer Portfolio Website

This site is to be used by potential recruiters/companys to explore the skills and some background information of Jason Blackburn. Following this, there is also a contact form at the bottom, whilst it is static at the moment, when fully functional, this will allow users to contact the developer directly from the site itself. There is also an attached PDF which is linked to the 'Download CV' button, where recruiters/hiring managers can view and download a copy of the CV.

# Colour Scheme <a name="color-scheme"></a>

The site is built with design in mind, whilst still being rated highly for accessibility on Google Lighthouse. I have used dark colors for the header and footer background and light colors for the font to make it pop and stand out. The opposite has been done for the content itself, using bright background colours with a black font colour. This is done in hopes that it will draw the user in.

## Body Colour

This color is used for the background of the body, although its not seen throughout the page, it looks better than the standard white if the user was to see it.

## Main Section Colours

Here we have the colours for each section of the website. I wanted to make them bright and eye catching, whilst still being easy to read text over.

## Navbar and Footer Colours

The navbar and footer colours are dark, so that they stand out from the main content of the page. The font colour in this section is also white rather than black to be easily visable.

## Font Family

I have used a traditional code styled font in the nav and footer, this was a purely aesthetic decision to give it a slightly different look to the main content.

I have used two fonts for the main content of the page. Bebas Neue for titles and headings and Ubuntu for the content itself. Whilst they are not too different from each other, it adds a nice variety to the page.

# Wireframes <a name="wireframes"></a>

I have made wire frames for desktop, mobile and tablet view. These can be seen below. I have utlised a hamburger style menu for the smaller window sizes on mobile and tablet. This is to keep things looking clean and not too busy. I have also used a mixture of media queries and boostrap to make the page fully responsive.
