# Business <a name="business"></a>

The business goals of this page are to provide accurate weather information to the user.

## External Users Goals

The external users goals of this page are to provide accurate weather information for any location around the globe. Including humidity, wind speed and temperature.

## Site Owners Goals

The site owners goals of this page are to provide clear weather data using the Open Weather API.

# Colour Scheme <a name="color-scheme"></a>

The site uses a background image of a city skyline at night. I've also added a dark border with a low opacity around the div containing the weather information. To make this stand out I've included a bright green border around the div, buttons and input fields. On hover these turn bright green.

## Body Colour

The body for this site uses an image of a city skyline. This fills the entire page with no repeats and is scalable on large and small screens including mobile.

## Font Family

![image](readMeImgs/Screenshot%202023-02-23%20at%2012.09.48.png)

I have used a font from Google Fonts named Outfit. Outfit is clean and easy to read and makes for a better alternative to the standard fonts in my opinion.

# Wireframes <a name="wireframes"></a>

I have made wire frames for desktop, mobile and tablet view. These can be seen below. I have utlised a hamburger style menu for the smaller window sizes on mobile and tablet. This is to keep things looking clean and not too busy. I have also used a mixture of media queries and boostrap to make the page fully responsive.
